## Our Mission
<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a social enterprise on a mission: to use open standards, open source software, open data, and anything else open and transparent, to improve Adult Social Care. 

​We believe that open source software is set to become a major force in all vertical ​markets in the next few years, not just technology, and social care will be no exception.
## News Update
It’s hard to imagine a tougher time for a home care provider to roll out a new IT system, but congratulations to Noel Williams and his team at Calon Lan Community Care Ltd who have done just that.
 
Only a few weeks after their (online) training, <span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span>'s mobile eMAR solution is now live across their North Wales branch network. And Noel has already started extending it to his franchise network in England, Blue Ribbon Community Care.
 
Noel explained, “We serve hundreds of clients across a wide area and needed to monitor medication without physically collecting MAR paperwork. Real time alerts would help us deal with issues as they occur and, importantly, evidence our actions.
 
We considered a number of software providers over six months, and already knew what Mark Chapman could do. We needed a low cost, flexible solution, compatible with any mobile phone device. <span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> stood out, and they’ve been keen to work with us to develop their solution further. Several features we suggested have already been added.
 
It’s an open source solution with no long contracts. However, we want stability for the future and we’re already looking at their other products to give our teams a one stop shop for medication, scheduling, records and care planning”.
