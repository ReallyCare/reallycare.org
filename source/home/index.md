## Our Mission
<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a social enterprise on a mission: to use open standards, open source software, open data, and anything else open and transparent, to improve Adult Social Care. 

​We believe that open source software is set to become a major force in all vertical ​markets in the next few years, not just technology, and social care will be no exception.  Our flagship product Plait - for running homecare businesses - is built on open source libraries and will be open sourced itself.
