## Our Mission
<div class="flex">
<div class="w-80 mr2">
<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a social enterprise on a mission: to use open standards, open source software, open data, and anything else open and transparent, to improve Adult Social Care. 

​We believe that open source software is set to become a major force in all vertical ​markets in the next few years, not just technology, and social care will be no exception.  Our flagship product Plait - for running homecare businesses - is built on open source libraries and will be open sourced itself.

As we are a not for profit company, anything we make from our software is either re-invested into improving our products and services or donated to worthy organisations in the care space.  So far the small amount of profit we have made has been contributed to a [local dementia charity](https://tn22clubs.org/).
