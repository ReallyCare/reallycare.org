## Our Mission
<div class="flex">
<div class="w-80 mr2">
<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a social enterprise on a mission: to use open standards, open source software, open data, and anything else open and transparent, to improve Adult Social Care. 

​We believe that open source software is set to become a major force in all vertical ​markets in the next few years, not just technology, and social care will be no exception.  Our flagship product Plait - for running homecare businesses - is built on open source libraries and will be open sourced itself.

As we are a not for profit company, anything we make from our software is either re-invested into improving our products and services or donated to worthy organisations in the care space.  So far the small amount of profit we have made has been contributed to a [local dementia charity](https://tn22clubs.org/).

## News Updates

Not exactly big news, but we have finally been forced to spend much more money than was sensible (but the least we could) to get someone to mark our homework to get an actual (well - virtual) [Cyber Essentials Plus certificate](https://registry.blockmarktech.com/certificates/5606c33c-93ae-4bf5-9c01-62fd11f4943b/?share_key=vk1Q-s5QbxG6VHoI87aGtffKheP9HqXrHID1V7d59pk).  It is one of the mandatory requirements to get on the Assured Suppliers List, which we aim to do as soon as possible.

The June 2023 Homecare magazine (the member magazine of the [Homecare Association](https://homecareassociation.org.uk)) contains an article about our key values and how they apply to Homecare by our founder Mark Chapman entitled "All things open".  If you are not a member of the Homecare Association you can download the article [here](img/HomecareJune2023AllThingsOpen.pdf).

We enjoyed meeting old friends and making new contacts at the Health Plus Care show in the Excel Centre.
