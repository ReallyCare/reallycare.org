## Our Mission
<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a social enterprise on a mission: to use open standards, open source software, open data, and anything else open and transparent, to improve Adult Social Care. 

​We believe that open source software is set to become a major force in all vertical ​markets in the next few years, not just technology, and social care will be no exception.

This interface enables existing PASS system users to transition off their legacy scheduling systems onto a modern, well supported scheduling system without their care workers having to change a thing!
