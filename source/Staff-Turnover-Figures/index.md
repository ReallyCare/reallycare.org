<p class="f6 lh-copy">Please note: ReallyCare CIC is a tiny company, so these figures are not intended to be serious - more an illustration of my ideas that I [blogged](/2012/06/08/Staff-Turnover/) about.</p>

Each quarter (1st of March, June, September and December) we will report on the proportion of our work force that was working for the company (I would say on the payroll, but we aren't yet making any money, so we are only talking about volunteers here) on the previous quarter day who are no longer working for the company.

### Percentage Staff Turnover in last 3 months:
- 0% - 1st June 2012
- 0% - 1st Sept 2012
- 0% - 1st Dec 2012
- 0% - 1st March 2013
- 0% - 1st June 2013
- 0% - 1st September 2013
- 0% - 1st December 2013
- 0% - 1st March 2014
- 0% - 1st June 2014

....this is getting a bit boring.  If we ever actually start taking people on and losing them I will update it!
