<span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> is a not-for-profit community interest company, founded to encourage and support the development and use of open source software in the adult social care space.  We believe in the power of community, and there is no better example of what can be achieved through collaboration than open source software.

​Ageing populations are to be found all over the developed world and while people are generally healthier and living more fulfilled lives into an older age than ever before, at some point a significant number of elderly people need some form of care.  

​We believe that software can help in two ways - by making care provision more efficient, and by ensuring quality of provision.
