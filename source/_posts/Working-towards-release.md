Having been working for years on various elements that make up the social care system of the future (yet without having completed any of them) it is beginning to look like we are in danger of having something we are proud enough of to open source (and make available as a SAAS product).  Hurrah!

So we are starting to check our site (which has been in operation free of charge with friendly users for quite a while) meets requirements in areas that we have not been specifically focussing on.  So today when the Sainsbury's Bank site got some poor publicity for getting an F in a security test we ran the same test on our hosted site.  You can see below that we are doing OK (well - better than that - top marks!).

Our new site is up in the top tier - alongside Republican candidate for the presidential election Jeb Bush!

Hopefully it won't be too long before you can see what else we have been up to...
