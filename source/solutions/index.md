## Plait (Home Care Management)

[Plait](https://www.plaitapp.org)  is an end-to-end next generation community care management solution.  Truly multi-platform (desktop, tablet, mobile), Plait is the culmination of years of experience in designing and delivering IT platforms for social care providers.
​
Plait is built on open source technologies, and, when it is all production ready, it will be open sourced itself.  That means that you don't necessarily need to be dependent on <span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> (unless you want to be) and can make whatever changes you want to the software.  Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xX655DqkikrifKdelkSmw) will give you a good idea of what it is like.

### Scheduling
Our scheduling system is a huge leap forward in usability from the legacy homecare systems, exports to your accounts and payroll, and is fully integrated with our point of care system.

### Care Planning
Partially funded by a Catalyst scaling grant from the [RSA](https://www.thersa.org/) (our founder is a Fellow) our newest addition optimises the whole process of handling referrals, completing assessments and publishing care plans, including highlighting changes at the point of care.

### Recruitment 
A slick, automated way of managing applicants and the complete recruitment workflow

### Medication Management
Comprehensive medication administration, in the office and at the point of care via our mobile app for care workers

If you would like to be a part of this project, perhaps with a view to implementing Plait
​at your care organisation, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Plait Mobile
Plait Mobile is the point of care system that works alongside Plait.  It incorporates eMARs, task management, access to care plan and much more.  Service users and their relatives can be granted appropriate access.
