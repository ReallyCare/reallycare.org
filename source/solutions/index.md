## Plait (Home Care Management)

[Plait](https://www.plaitapp.org)  is an end-to-end next generation community care management solution.  Truly multi-platform (desktop, tablet, mobile), Plait is the culmination of years of experience in designing and delivering IT platforms for social care providers.
â€‹
Plait is built on open source technologies, and, when it is all production ready, it will be open sourced itself.  That means that you don't necessarily need to be dependent on <span style="font-size: large; color:#ad1340">really<span style="font-weight:bold">care</span> CIC</span> (unless you want to be) and can make whatever changes you want to the software.  Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8xX655DqkikrifKdelkSmw) will give you a good idea of what it is like.  Start with a 10 minute introduction [here](https://youtu.be/DN78wkst6uc).

Don't take our word for it - one of our users has a [Success Story](https://www.digitalcarehub.co.uk/success-story/gardiners-homecare-implementing-person-centred-technology/) on the DigitalCare Hub website.
